## Process 1: Problem Statement
### Roleplay: The number of fradulent credit card transactions (FTs) happening is on the rise. I assume the role of an analyst in the bank tasked to come up with strategies to reduce the incidence of credit card scams based on available data.

## Process 3: [Data Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/eugene.f7634/viz/CreditCardFraudProject/Location)
## Process 4: Insights & Recommendations
  * Direct advertising resources/ campaigns towards cities which has the highest incidence of card owners involved in FTs (e.g. New York, Pennsylvania and Texas).
  * Allocate more manpower and resources to the handling and processing of FTs during peak months and hours.
  * Prioritize the analysis of suspicious transactions from high-risk categories (internet transactions, in-store grocery shopping) might improve the time taken to spot a fraudulent transaction.
  * Emails, mails and application notifications can be sent with increased frequency to populations (e.g. age 20-60) with higher incidents of FTs to educate them on prevention strategies such as 2-Factor Authentication
